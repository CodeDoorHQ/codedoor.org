        <h1>Welcome Students to CodeDoor.org / Willkommen bei CodeDoor.org!</h1>
        <p>English speaking Students</p><br>
		We currently accept applications for the first batch of students. If you are between 12 and 30 years old we are happy when you apply.  
        Please fill out the form below and we will get back to you if you are accepted to the program.

        Have you ever wondered how a computer knows what to do? Are you keen in learning how to find out how to program? Completing the CodeDoor.org curriculum will bring you on a path to become an effective programmer. And the best: You will not just learn to code, you will meet others in your batch that also start to learn and soon you will have your own web page and a portfolio of programs.

        When the program starts you will get access to pcs and laptops and a room where to study. You will meet with us once a week on an afternoon and learn how to program. On all other afternoons, you are of course free to practice programming. 

        In the End you will receive a CodeDegree that will show others that you master foundational programming knowledge and skills that all programmers use whether they program mobile apps, create web pages or analyze data.

        One more thing. Sometimes we eat spaghetti together. 

        Are you interested? Then apply now. Just fill out the form:
